# Bootstrap
A Git repository for the MOOC "Front-End Web UI Frameworks and Tools: Bootstrap 4"


This course gave me an overview of client-side web UI frameworks, in particular Bootstrap 4.
I learnt about grids and responsive design, Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript components. 
I learnt about CSS preprocessors, Less and Sass.
This course also includes an honors track that enables you to work on your own project developing a website using Bootstrap 4.

See https://www.coursera.org/learn/bootstrap-4/ for more details.
